I'd like to make a ... script? widget? something I can run in linux shell that profides updates to my claude usage.  So I can watch it like I would task manager or such while I work.  it should keep track of how much i've spent over time when I go into extra usage. more details to come.  also search online for existing tools.

I like the style of btop

I want it to be able to do the following

Update every few seconds or so ideally

Make sure running it isnt going to eat in to my cluade usage obviously

include in this project detailed documentation eventually replacing this read me file

include a setup or install script that set this in a logical system location so it can be run from my shell just like btop and other commands

show me my current claude usage similar to /usage in claude

When my usage resets (date and time)

Dives deeper into the usage metrics.  /usage just gives % I'd like to also see numbers out of a total even if we have to estimate but lets be as accurate as we can.  I assume this is based on tokens?  Which are sent and recieved? I'm not sure on that.

I'm currently on the pro plan.

I want it to also track how much extra usage I use.
I currently allow up to $50 per month.

I'd love a bar graph or something to show the last 7 days of usage.
Stack "usage included in pro plan" with "extra usage" in a different color or such to allow me to see
quickly trends over time on a per day basis.
I should be able to scroll with a key press back ward and forward on that graph to see older data.

We should store the data locally in a local file, json? something please make recommendations.

I'd like it to include useful metrics.

Units per day, and $ per day
